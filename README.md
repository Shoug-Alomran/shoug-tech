# SHOUG.TECH

**SHOUG.TECH** is my personal technical portfolio and knowledge platform, built to document and showcase my work across **software engineering, cybersecurity, academic resources, workshops, and applied projects**.

The platform serves as both a professional portfolio and a structured technical knowledge base, bringing together projects, coursework, security labs, documentation, study resources, and professional development in one place.

## About

I’m **Shoug Fawaz Alomran**, a Software Engineering and Cybersecurity student focused on building, analyzing, securing, and documenting technical systems.

My primary areas of interest include:

- **Software Engineering** — designing and developing structured, maintainable software systems
- **Cybersecurity** — developing practical skills in penetration testing, security analysis, and defensive awareness
- **Technical Documentation** — transforming complex academic and technical material into structured, accessible resources
- **Knowledge Systems** — building platforms and workflows that organize learning, projects, and technical information
- **Technical Workshops** — creating and delivering practical learning experiences around development and technology

SHOUG.TECH documents that work through real projects, academic material, technical resources, workshops, and continuously evolving documentation.

- Reference resources

### Work

A professional overview of my technical work, including:

- Software projects
- Cybersecurity work
- Technical platforms
- Development experience
- Professional and academic contributions

### Workshops

Documentation and supporting resources for technical workshops I have developed or delivered.

### Resources

A curated technical directory containing tools, references, learning platforms, development resources, cybersecurity material, and other useful links.

### About

Background information, professional interests, technical focus areas, policies, and site information.

## Local Development

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shoug-Alomran/shoug-tech.git
cd shoug-tech
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-static-i18n
```

Start the local development server:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

The local site will typically be available at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## Bilingual Architecture

SHOUG.TECH supports both **English and Arabic** content using `mkdocs-static-i18n`.

Arabic pages follow the naming convention:

```text
page.md
page.ar.md
```

Several internal utilities help maintain synchronization between both versions.

### EN/AR Parity Check

Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_i18n_parity.py
```

Strict validation:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_i18n_parity.py --strict
```

Automatically create placeholders for missing Arabic pages:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_i18n_parity.py --autofix-missing-ar
```

## Arabic Synchronization Utility

`scripts/sync_arabic.py` assists with synchronizing English content into formal, Saudi-friendly Arabic while preserving Markdown structure.

Dry run:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync_arabic.py
```

Create missing Arabic files:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key python3 scripts/sync_arabic.py --apply
```

Update existing Arabic files when their corresponding English content changes:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key python3 scripts/sync_arabic.py --apply --update-existing
```

Additional options include:

```text
--backup
```

Creates a `.bak` file before overwriting existing content.

```text
--limit N
```

Processes only the first `N` files.

```text
--force
```

Ignores the translation hash cache and forces regeneration.

## Pre-Release Quality Assurance

Before deployment, the project can be validated using:

```bash
bash scripts/preflight_qa.sh
```

The QA process includes:

- English/Arabic parity validation
- Missing Arabic-page detection
- Strict MkDocs builds
- Clean build generation
- Theme asset validation
- Logo and favicon validation
- Route validation
- Internal-link validation
- Static-asset validation

## Deployment

Deployment is automated through **GitHub Actions**.

On pushes to the `main` branch, the deployment workflow:

1. Installs project dependencies
2. Runs English/Arabic parity checks
3. Builds the MkDocs site using strict validation
4. Validates generated routes
5. Checks internal links and assets
6. Publishes the generated site through GitHub Pages

Workflow:

```text
.github/workflows/deploy-mkdocs.yml
```

The primary public domain is:

**https://shoug-tech.com/**

## Project Philosophy

SHOUG.TECH is built around a simple principle:

> Build useful systems, understand how they work, secure them where possible, and document what was learned.

The platform is designed to evolve alongside my academic, technical, and professional work rather than functioning as a static portfolio.
