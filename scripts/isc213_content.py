  <li>General <strong>c</strong>ustom ('urf) already admits the author's right and that it can be compensated.</li>
  <li><strong>P</strong>lagiarism is prohibited — misattributing statements is strictly forbidden.</li>
  <li><strong>R</strong>ights correspond to responsibilities — "the benefit runs with the burden."</li>

<div class="callout evidence"><div class="callout-label">Evidence</div>

<div class="callout slides"><div class="callout-label">From the slides</div>
A second definition: a patent is <strong>a document issued by an official office</strong>, working in the name of different countries, on request. It gives the owner the right to use the invention named in it and to benefit by selling or distributing it. The slides also set a class activity on the <strong>SAIP</strong> (Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property) website: what does intellectual property mean, what is a patent, and what are the conditions for obtaining one?</div>

<h3>Rights and ruling</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exclusive right</strong> — exclusive use, distinguishing the business and preventing imitation.</li>
  <li><strong>Transferable asset</strong> — measurable financial value; the owner may sell, gift, or transfer it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Legally recognised, on condition it is <strong>not based on cheating or gharar</strong>. The reasoning mirrors Copyright's — all four reasons apply.</p>
<div class="callout mistake"><div class="callout-label">Common mistake</div>
Trade name is the only one of the three with an explicit conditional caveat. Do not drop it when answering a trade-name ruling question.</div>
<div class="callout slides"><div class="callout-label">From the slides</div>
<strong>Names used on the slides:</strong> the three parts of a trade name are the <em>slogan / trademark</em>, the <em>commercial address</em>, and the <em>location</em>. The trademark functions appear as "functions of the trade name": attracting clients, differentiating the goods from similar goods, and restricting competition to protect the product.<br>
<strong>Trademark definition:</strong> names, words, signatures, letters, symbols, numbers, titles, seals, designs, graphics, images, distinctive engravings, packaging, shapes, colours or colour combinations — any sign used to distinguish a business's goods or services.<br>
<strong>Saudi law:</strong> Saudi Arabia adopted the unified GCC Trademark Law (effective September 2016) and is a member of the GCC Patent Law and GCC Customs Law, which align IP practice across Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, and the UAE. Patents and trademarks are both granted on a <strong>first-to-file</strong> basis, so protect them before launching a product.</div>

<h3>The philosophy</h3>
<p>Insurance rests on <strong>collective risk-sharing</strong>: one person could be crushed by a disaster's full cost, but pooling relief expenses across a large group makes the burden manageable. That cooperative ideal was compromised when insurance shifted from mutual aid to a profit-driven commercial enterprise.</p>
<div class="callout mnemonic"><div class="callout-label">Mnemonic</div>
"Started as sharing the burden. Became selling the promise." That sentence is the hinge the whole lecture swings on.</div>
<div class="callout slides"><div class="callout-label">From the slides</div>
The slides draw the philosophy as a crowd: everyone pays in, only the few marked in red are hit by a disaster, and the pooled money covers them. Everyone carries a small, certain cost so no one carries a large, sudden one.</div>

</tbody></table></div>

<h3>Legal ruling</h3>
<p>Scholars agree social / cooperative insurance is fully lawful in all its forms, because it fulfils the Islamic objective of mutual solidarity rather than commercial profit.</p>
<div class="callout mnemonic"><div class="callout-label">Mnemonic</div>
"Donation contract &rarr; no riba &rarr; fully lawful." The entire ruling in nine words.</div>

<h3>How a collaborative contract actually works</h3>
<p>Collaborative associations collect donated subscriptions, invest them, and use the pool plus investment profits to cover subscriber risks. Any <strong>surplus</strong> after settling claims belongs entirely to the participants — they can take it back or roll it into future payments.</p>
<div class="callout mistake"><div class="callout-label">Common mistake</div>
The managing company may administer the surplus and its investment interest, but may <strong>not keep any of it</strong>. Ownership stays with the participants.</div>
<div class="callout slides"><div class="callout-label">From the slides</div>
The slides list the contract in four points: collect subscriptions from members; manage and invest the money for the members' benefit; the managing body may deduct a sum <strong>for the effort of management only</strong>; and the surplus is <strong>reinvested in the fund</strong>, never paid to the managing company.</div>

Naming only gharar. It is a three-part combination — and you must know which riba maps to which payout: more-than-paid = fa&#7693;l; equal-to-paid = nas&#299;'ah; nothing-paid = plain illegitimate taking.</div>
